This app lets you explore the demographics of Census Tracts in the state of California. The data comes from the 2013 [American Community Survey (ACS)](http://www.census.gov/acs/www/). 

The source code for this app is available [here](https://github.com/arilamstein/ca-tract-shiny). The accompanying blog post is [here](http://www.arilamstein.com/blog/2015/06/18/new-app-for-exploring-census-tract-demographics/).
