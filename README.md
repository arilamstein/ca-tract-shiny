# ca-tract-shiny

This repository contains code for a web application that allows users to explore the demographics of
US Census Tracts in California. You can see the running application [here](https://www.shinyapps.io/admin/#/application/45368).
The app is written in R.

The app is intended as an example of a few technologies:

1. My package [choroplethrCaCensusTract](https://github.com/arilamstein/choroplethrCaCensusTract), which makes it easy to deal 
with California Census Tracts and Data in R.
2. [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com/), the web application framework in R.
